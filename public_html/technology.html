            <p><a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>stands for hypertext mark up language and it is used used by the World Wide Web.<br />
                The WWW runs on the internet which is an international network of computers which communicate information with each other in a standardised way.<br />
                It does not matter what type of computer you are using to access the information so long as both systems conform to a standard language for transmitting the text and data.<br /> 
                You may be familiar with Hypertext applications running on desktop computers. Unlike a conventional page description language, HTML does not <br />
                define how the text is to appear. Instead, parts of the text are marked as having certain attributes, such as being a title or a heading. The actual <br />
                appearance of these styles is set by the viewing program to give consistency between all documents. You would be surprised at how easy it is to set up a document like this!<br />
                Members of staff who would like to contribute are encouraged to contact us. If you have documents and pictures already in a computer readable form then it may<br />
                be fairly easy to edit them and link them into this system.<br />
